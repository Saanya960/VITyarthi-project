# PYTHON ESSENTIALS
PROJECT-'COLLEGE MARKS TRACKER SYSTEM'
# OVERVIEW
In most colleges, student marks are recorded manually using registers or simple spreadsheets, due to which there are high chances of calculation mistakes (totals).Also, it is time-consuming and inefficient for faculty during exams or assessments. A digital solution is required to simplify the process of entering, storing, analyzing, and exporting student marks.
# features
A marks tracker system offering marks of 8 courses to be stored in excel form.
1. Provides a simple and user-friendly GUI.
2. Allows entering Student ID and navigating through the interface.
3. Validates user input (e.g., empty fields, incorrect values).
4. Displays error and success messages for proper guidance.
5. Exports all stored student data to an Excel file.
6. Includes Student ID, course-wise marks, and total marks in the report.
7. Shows a confirmation message once the file is saved.
8. Ensures the report can be printed, shared, or stored for institutional use.
