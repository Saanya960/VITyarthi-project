# Problem statement
In most colleges, student marks are recorded manually using registers or simple spreadsheets, due to which there are high chances of calculation mistakes (totals).Also, it is time-consuming and inefficient for faculty during exams or assessments. A digital solution is required to simplify the process of entering, storing, analyzing, and exporting student marks
# Scope of the project
The scope of this project includes developing a GUI-based Marks Tracker System that allows users to input, manage, and store academic marks for 50 students across 8 courses. The system provides an easy interface for entering student details, validating inputs, calculating total scores, and displaying results in a structured table. It also includes an automated Excel export feature for generating reports that can be shared or archived. The project focuses on efficient data handling, user-friendly interaction, and accurate report generation, ensuring that college faculty or administrators can manage student marks quickly and reliably.
# Target users
1.College Faculty Members: Primary users who enter student marks, review data, and generate reports for academic evaluation.
2.Academic Administrators: Use the system to maintain centralized student performance records and export reports for documentation.
3.Department Coordinators: Utilize the data for internal assessments, audits, and performance tracking.
4.Students (Indirectly): Benefit from accurate and organized record-keeping, though they do not interact directly with the system.
5.Data Entry Operators/Assistants: Can use the GUI to quickly input marks without technical knowledge of programming
# High-level features
User-Friendly GUI: Simple and intuitive interface for entering student details and marks across 8 courses.
1.Input Validation: Ensures correct numeric entries and alerts users about errors instantly.
2.Automated Calculations: Computes total marks for each student using NumPy for accurate and fast processing.
3.Data Display Table: Real-time viewing of all entered records in a structured, scrollable table.
4.Excel Report Export: Generates a well-formatted Excel file containing all student marks and totals.
5.Modular Design: Clear separation of GUI, data-processing, and reporting layers for maintainability.
